## Welcome!

I'm glad you're here. I'm Lucca and I've been a Data Scientist for some time now. I've started my journey in Brazil (where I'm originally from) but eventually life brought me to France, where I am today.  

I've worked in many different sectors ranging from software companies to consulting, so I have some experience on a broad amount of topics. Today, I work in a software company building data solutions for retail.  

Welcome to my blog. Here is where I share some of my views on data and some of the projects I've built.  

If you want to get in contact with me, feel free to reach out over [**LinkedIn**](https://linkedin.com/in/luccabgomes) or [**GitHub**](https://github.com/bglucca)
