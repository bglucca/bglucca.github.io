## Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lucca.

    <p> I'm a brazilian engineer turned Data Scientist, after noticing that all my favorite subjects revolved around Data and Statistics. I've worked for many years in Brazil after some life opportunities brought me to Paris, where I currently live and work</p> 
    <p>I'm currently a Machine Learning Engineer working in a company that develops data products for retail. Beyond my current position I have a quite extensive background across many different sectors on the account of having also worked in consulting. This gave me a broad spectrum of experiences, as well as developed a lot of my soft-skills, since I had a significant amount of client-facing time.</p>
    <p>Over the course of my career I've worked on a lot of topics around statistics and ML (see more below). More recently I have been involved in projects in AI, developing applications using LLMs and SLMs to create business solutions such as Text-to-SQL solutions in a Big Data context.</p>
    <p>From a personal side of things, I'm really into music, reading and sports. I've practiced Wushu (Kung Fu) for many years. Also, I'm really interested in languages. I'm fluent in Portuguese, English, German and (now) French. </p>

## My Experiences
#### Vusion Group - ML Engineer: 2024-Now
This is my current position where I've started off as a Data Scientist. Today I'm the Machine Learning team where we focus a lot on R&D over many topics such as:
- Gen AI applications using LangGraph
- Time Series Forecasting for a high volume of products (200k + references)
- Price Optimization

Beyond these topics above I have extensive experience working with Big Data, PySpark and Databricks to develop data solutions in a big data context. Also, I did a large amount of Python Development for data applications.
#### EloGroup - Data Scientist: 2021-2023
At EloGroup I was a Data Scientist for projects over many different subjects. Here I've had the opportunity to lead teams and scope Data Science and Analytics projects. I worked on many different issues and projects including:
- Developing Big Data solutions in public finances and telecommunications;
- Market data analysis for supply chain and customer segmentation (unsupervised learning);
- Time series analysis for commercial strategy decision;
And other projects

#### GovernanÃ§a Brasil - Data Analyst: 2020-2021
Here I've worked in different projects, but this was my first contact with Selenium for web-scraping and ETL transformations to structure the data.  

I've also participated in the development of a product that tracked on a daily basis the vaccinated population of brazilian cities, so that mayors could know when to relax or to tighten the lockdown decisions during the Covid-19 pandemic. The data was publicly available over an ElastiSearch API and was extracted and transformed using Python.
